This is an express app with a custom cookie parser middleware. it mimics what the actual cookie-parser module does. it parses the cookie from the request. If it's a signed cookie, it verifies it and if it's true then parses the cookie and attach it to req.signedCookies object. Otherwise, any cookie set will be available in the req.cookies object.Furthermore, there are route guards to protect the different routes. for example, if someone is not an admin user, they won't be allowed to access a certain route,only admin user are.
